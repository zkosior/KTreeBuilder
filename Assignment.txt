Tree Builder

Your task is to write a program that creates a K-nary tree (i.e. a tree where every node has
up to K children) to represent numbers in a K-based system.

Each node, aside from the root, has an assigned value from 0 to K-1, starting with the left-
most child. A given number X, while represented in the K-based system, is stored as a path
in the K-nary tree with the most significant digit stored in one of the root’s children. Many
numbers can share the same node for the same level of the tree i.e.: in the Sample 1 below,
numbers 1 and 2 share the node ‘1’.

Once the tree is built, the program should output the tree contents in the post order. You
can assume the root is simply empty.

Input (via standard input):

First line contains the tree order (2 <= K <= 9). Further lines contain integers to be
represented in the specified K-based system and stored in the tree (from 1 to 1 000 000).
Input ends with a 0 value.

Output (via standard output):

Tree content in the post order, all in one line.

Sample 1:
Input:
2
1
2
0

Output:
01

Sample 2:
Input:
4
7
43

0

Output:
